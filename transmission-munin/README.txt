The contents of this folder aren't really related to transmission-remote-dotnet,
but since it's a trivial project which is related to transmission-daemon
I'll keep it here.

It's a transmission-daemon plugin for munin, which is a graphing framework
similar to nagios for system administrators to generate graphs about their
servers.

I may or may not document or develop this.

This tutorial helped me setup munin:
